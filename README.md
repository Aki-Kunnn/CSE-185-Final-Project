# CSE-185-Final-Project

This is a demonstration project for CSE185. It implements a recreation of the kmergenie tool. See the [Kmergenie](http://kmergenie.bx.psu.edu/) page for more details.

# Install Instructions

To install the package, clone the repository and use `pip`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cse-185-final-project.git

cd cse-185-final-project

pip install .
```

# Basic Usage
Once package is successfully installed, it can be called from the command line like many other tools. 

```bash
vanheusden -k <kmerLength> <reads>
```

For example:
```bash
vanheusden -k 15 example_file.fasta
```

The following command will compute kmers of length 15, first by reading the file and eventually outputting the results to a file named 'example_file.histo.tsv'

# Our Tool Options

- -k, --kmerLength: The length of the k-mers to analyze.
  
- reads: The file containing DNA sequencing reads.

# File Format

The file should be in FASTA format.

The output file will be in TSV (Tab-Separated Values) format, with two columns:

Count: The count of k-mers.
Number of k-mers: The number of k-mers that appeared that many times.
