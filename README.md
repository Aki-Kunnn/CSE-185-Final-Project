# CSE-185-Final-Project

This is a demonstration project for CSE185. It implements a recreation of the kmergenie tool. See the [Kmergenie](http://kmergenie.bx.psu.edu/) page for more details.

# Install Instructions

To install the package, clone the repository and use `pip`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cse-185-final-project.git

cd vanheusden
```

# Example Usage
The following command generated a random genome of length 10,000 and used that to simulate a fasta file with 1,000 reads of length 100 and an error rate of 0.001.

```
python3 vanheusden.py generate -g 10000 -n 1000 -l 100 -e 0.001
```

Then the following command estimated the genome size to be 10199: 

```bash
python3 vanheusden.py -k 50 g10000_n1000_l100_e0.001.fasta
```

# Options
python3 vanheusden.py generate -g [genome size] -n [number of reads] -l [length of reads] -e [error rate]

python3 vanheusden.py estimate -k [kmer length] [fasta file]
